## Overview

### Screenshot

![](/screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### Continued development

In future projects I want to continue to work on layout such as flexbox and grid to continue to grow as a front end developer using layouts

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Looking both through the resources and I also had MDN AI help me with the layout, hopefully I will become more familiar with Flexbox and attempt a similiar project soon
