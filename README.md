### Continued development

In future projects I want to continue to work on layout such as flexbox and grid to continue to grow as a front end developer using layouts


### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Looking both through the resources and I also had MDN AI help me with the layout, hopefully I will become more familiar with Flexbox and attempt a similiar project soon
